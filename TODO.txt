- Implement binary segmentation
    - Adapt the full-output model to perform binary segmentation
    - Write the dataset class for this problem


- Add necessary features for usage in the cluster:
    x To write results into a file 
    x Checkpointing
    - WandB integration for better metric logging


- Define metrics to log:
    x Loss
    - Dice
    x IoU (Jaccard)
    - Precision, recall


- (Multi) GPU training
    x Fix potential memory leak


- Replace print with logging


- Implement All-at-once training scheme from the FCN paper


- Improvement of the model
    - Implement and test regularization techniques
